Tired of waitings 10 seconds before your tests run?

== Quick usage instructions

1.  Insert the following lines at the very top of <tt>test/test_helper.rb</tt>:
      require 'rails_test_serving'
      RailsTestServing.boot

2.  Start the server:
      cd <project-dir>
      ruby test/test_helper.rb --serve

3.  Run tests as you usually do:
      ruby test/unit/account_test.rb
      ruby test/unit/account_test.rb -n /balance/
    As a consequence, they work in RubyMate too (⌘ + R in TextMate).

== Notes

* The first run will be slow as Rails is loading. Subsequent runs will be fast.
* If the server is not started, tests fall back to running the usual way.

== Caveats

There exists some quirks: search for "TODO" in the source. I can bear them but
contributions are welcome!
